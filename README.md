# AVR_library

In this repository you can find all my microcontroller .h & .c files for ATMega and PSOC in there respective branches.
All this code is simple raw ansi C, some have more complex implementations.
The source files are categorised into folders for easy searching.
The contents of this library are sourced of all the small projects I have coded over the past years, which are not hosted on Github.

The hardware used are:
- ATMega32 on a selfmade proto board.
- Arduino nano (ATMega326p) programmed with avrdude (no arduino environment).
- PSOC5LP protyping kit.

## Contents of this library
